Hello! My name is Javier Flores, and I'm an experienced Android developer with a passion for using cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. One of my recent projects was an industrial safety device detection app that uses object detection and TensorFlow Lite to identify safety devices in industrial settings.

## Project Description

The industrial safety device detection app was developed using TensorFlow Lite and other AI technologies to analyze images and identify safety devices such as lockout tagout (LOTO) devices. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to take photos of equipment and quickly identify any missing or improperly installed safety devices. The app is designed to be used by safety inspectors, equipment operators, and maintenance personnel to improve safety and compliance in industrial settings.

## Technologies Used

The industrial safety device detection app was developed using a number of cutting-edge technologies, including:

Object detection using TensorFlow Lite and Android CameraX API
Image analysis using OpenCV and NumPy
Front-end development using Kotlin and Android Jetpack components
Back-end development using Firebase ML Kit and Cloud Functions
Database management using Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore
By leveraging the power of these technologies, we were able to create an app that is fast, accurate, and easy to use, even in challenging industrial environments.

## Results

The industrial safety device detection app has been well-received by its target audience, and has been used to improve safety and compliance in a number of different industrial settings. The app has also been featured in several industry publications and has won awards for its innovative use of AI and mobile technologies.

If you have a project that could benefit from the use of AI and cutting-edge mobile technologies, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to contact me to discuss your project and how I can help bring your vision to life.
