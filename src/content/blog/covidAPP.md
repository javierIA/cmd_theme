# Chihuahua COVID-19 Tracker App - 2020
I'm an experienced mobile app developer with a passion for creating apps that serve the public good. Over the years, I've worked on a number of projects in the public health space, including the Chihuahua COVID-19 Tracker App:
Chihuahua COVID-19 Tracker App - 2020

As the lead developer on this project, I was responsible for developing the app using Flutter and adding Bluetooth contact tracing functionality to help users identify potential exposure to COVID-19. The app also provides up-to-date information about the number of COVID-19 cases in the Chihuahua community, testing and vaccination locations, and guidelines for preventing the spread of the virus.

I worked closely with public health experts and software developers to ensure that the Chihuahua COVID-19 Tracker App was fast, efficient, and easy to use. The app is available for download on both the App Store and Google Play, and can be used on a wide range of devices. We believe that the app is a valuable resource for Chihuahua residents as we work together to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

## Technologies:
- Flutter
+ Bluetooth
