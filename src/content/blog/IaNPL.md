Hello! My name is Javier, and I'm an experienced app developer with a passion for creating solutions that improve efficiency and productivity. One of my recent projects was an invoice extraction app that uses NLP and AI to extract information from PDF invoice

## Project Description

The invoice extraction app was developed using natural language processing (NLP) and AI technologies to analyze PDF invoices and extract key data fields such as vendor name, invoice number, invoice date, and line item details. The app was built using Python and FastAPI, and leverages the powerful spaCy library for NLP tasks. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to upload PDF invoices and get an accurate extraction of the key data fields. The app is designed to be used by accounting and finance professionals to improve accuracy and efficiency in invoice processing.

## Technologies Used

The invoice extraction app was developed using a number of cutting-edge technologies, including:

Natural language processing (NLP) using spaCy
PDF parsing and analysis using PyPDF2
Machine learning and AI using TensorFlow
Front-end development using React and Redux
Back-end development using FastAPI
Database management using MongoDB
By leveraging the power of these technologies, we were able to create an app that is fast, accurate, and easy to use, even when processing large amounts of data.

## Results

The invoice extraction app has been well-received by its target audience, and has been used to process invoices in a number of different industries. The app has also been featured in several industry publications and has won awards for its innovative use of NLP and AI technologies.

If you have a project that could benefit from the use of NLP and AI technologies, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to contact me to discuss your project and how I can help bring your vision to life.
